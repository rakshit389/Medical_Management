     2. delete_order();             // for deleting medicine order
     3. modify();                   // for modifying complete medicine order
     4. receipt();                  // for printing receipt of order and pay bill
     5. daily_summary();  	    // for displaying daily summary of sale
     6. modify_order_list();	    // for modifying only some elements in order
